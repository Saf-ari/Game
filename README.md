# Game
The game is a detective searching a labyrinth for murders.  They have to leave the labyrinth and the only way to avoid being killed is shining your flashlight on the killers.  When you are not shining light on the killers they come and attack you.  If you pass over certain objects there are lights within the maze that will turn on by you clicking the spacebar.  Also in the maze are drops of blood and the detective wants to collect those (like game coins) as clues.  Each level has more murderers and less lights, etc.
